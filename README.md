  </details>
</details>

## Video Creatives
<details>
  <summary></summary>
  
1. Provide gameplay videos for ads (preferred via Google Drive) with game sounds (if there are ones).
2. Two videos are needed in a format of 1080x1350:
   A. Length of 2 minutes of different fails.
   B. Length of 3 minutes which include normal play, expert play, and satisfying moments (Unique scenes and highlights of the game).
3. Recording tips:
   - Please use the official Unity package called ‚ÄúUnity Recorder‚Äù. This package allows you to capture footage directly from the engine in all of the required resolutions, without any need for external software. You can install it from the package manager under the Unity Registry packages.
   - Once installed you can access it here (Window > General > Recorder > Recorder Window):
     ![recorderWindow](images/recorderWindow.png)
     ![recorderWindow](images/record.png)
   - Click ‚ÄúAdd Recorder‚Äù - make sure you add a Movie Sequence and remove the Image Sequence if there is one.
   - Source - Game View
   - Switch target fps to 60/30.
   - Make sure to change the output resolution to ‚ÄúCustom‚Äù. Change to the desired resolution (W1080xH1350) and record from the game view.
   - Press ‚ÄúStart Recording‚Äù, the game should start and the engine will record.
   - Reach your new captured footage file from the selected folder.
   - For further information regarding the tool, see the official unity guide: [About Unity Recorder](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.recorder@3.0/manual/index.html).

## SDK Implementation
<details>
  <summary></summary>  
**Please remove all other SDK‚Äôs before implementing Moon SDK!**  

   1. Downloading the MOON SDK   
The current version of the MOON SDK is version 1.3.5  (link is sent by slack bot)  
**Notice: For this test use only Facebook, Game analytics and Adjust SDKs features!**
  2. Setting Up Moon SDK:

  3. Import MoonSDK.unitypackage into your unity project.
  
  4. The MoonSDKScene must be the first in the list in the build settings, after initialization it will load the next scene in the list (with index 1).

     ![MoonSDKScene](images/MooneeScene.png)
     
  5. Open MoonSDK settings and fill in all app keys for analytics and advertising services which you want to use and press Check and Sync Settings button
    
     ![SyncSettings](images/SyncSettings.png)
 
 6. Initialization: Moon SDK is initialized automatically from the Moon SDK scene.

 7. Progression Events:
    
**Levels progression events using Adjust and Moonee's Developer's Dahboard:**

      MoonSDK.SendLevelDataStartEvent((GameModel.levelIndex + 1).ToString());  
      MoonSDK.SendLevelDataCompleteEvent(LevelStatus.complete, (GameModel.levelIndex + 1).ToString(), LevelResult.win, isContinueLevel); 


LevelDataCompleteEvent has a few arguments:
  1. **LevelStatus** - Indicates the current status of the level, which could be "start" when the level begins, "fail" if the player fails to complete it, or "complete" if the player finishes it without winning.
  2. **LevelResult** - Represents the outcome of the level, which could be "win" if the player successfully completes it or "fail" if the player fails to complete it.
  3. **isContinueLevel** - A boolean argument that indicates whether the player is continuing the level from where they left off (true) or starting it from the beginning (false). This is particularly useful for long idle levels or when there's a revive   
     option. If the game doesn't have these features, it should be set to false by default.


**Levels progression events using GameAnalytics:**  

      void MoonSDK.TrackLevelEvents(MoonSDK.LevelEvents eventType, int levelIndex);
      MoonSDK.TrackLevelEvents(MoonSDK.LevelEvents.Start, 1);

 8. Make sure you filled the mandatory keys for the test under Facebook, Game Analytics and Adjust Basics section
You will get the needed Adjust tokens from your Publisher Manager

## Commen Issues
<details>
  <summary></summary>  
Commen issues can be found here as well as in the "issue" section.
Please add your comments there as well, to allow other to gain from it.

**Importnat comments:**

</details>

## In-Game Fonts
<details>
  <summary></summary>  
In terms of in-game fonts, they must be official fonts from Google Fonts or Liberation Sans from Unity. Follow these steps to ensure compliance with font licensing:

1. Use only fonts from the Google Fonts library or Liberation Sans from Unity.
2. After selecting the relevant font, ensure you have the license for the game code as a text file.
3. Rename the license file to the following format: `Fontname_license.txt`.
4. Place both the font file and its license file in the Fonts directory of your project.
5. The most common font licenses are OFL (Open Font License) and Apache License.
6. Copy everything in the StreamingAssets directory to add a new licensed font, which will be automatically added to the build.
7. Fonts from Google Fonts can be used for both Android and iOS games. You can find them at [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
8. Unity typically has two built-in fonts:
   * Liberation Sans (free to use)
   * Arial (note: Arial is not free to use)
9. Refer to the following guides for embedding custom fonts in games:
   * Unity - Manual: [Font Assets](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-Font.html).

By adhering to these guidelines, you ensure that your game uses licensed fonts responsibly and legally.
